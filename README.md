There are many excellent books on artificial intelligence (AI) at the college level, 
but here are some highly recommended ones:

"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig - 
This is a classic textbook on AI that covers a wide range of topics, including problem-solving, 
knowledge representation, natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics.

1. "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville - This is a comprehensive 
guide to deep learning, one of the most important subfields of AI. It covers the theory and 
practical applications of neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, 
and generative models.

2. "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto - This book is 
a great introduction to reinforcement learning, a subfield of AI that focuses on how machines 
can learn to make decisions based on feedback from their environment. It covers the basic 
concepts, algorithms, and applications of reinforcement learning.

3. "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop - This is a comprehensive 
guide to machine learning that covers a wide range of topics, including classification, 
regression, clustering, and neural networks. It also includes practical examples and 
exercises to help readers apply the concepts.

4. "Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques" by Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman - 
This book is a great resource for learning about graphical models, which are a powerful tool for 
modeling complex systems. It covers the theory and algorithms for probabilistic graphical models, 
as well as practical applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, 
and bioinformatics.

These books provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in learning about AI at the college level.
